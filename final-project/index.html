          <p>
            While many businesses are struggling nationwide with paying salaries and dealing with layoffs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the theater industry has been hit particularly hard. With some jobs, working remotely is still possible. However, what about an industry where its primary source of income is heavily reliant on audiences gathering in one place?
          </p>

          <p>
            It has not been easy.  In Annapolis, the outdoor Summer Garden Theatre has to rent space in order to rehearse. However, since the shutdown orders, the rehearsal space has been closed, and rehearsing has been hard, Carolyn Kirby, president of the board of directors at the theater, told Capital News Service on March 30 via a phone call.
          </p>

            </div>

          <p>
            The theater’s season has three shows scheduled, with the first one, “Rock of Ages,” having been in its last stages of completion. It was postponed to the 2021 season even after having had about nine months of work done on it, but “now everything is in question,” Kirby said.
          </p>

          <p>
            For a performance in July, she said, you need more practice. However, the theater and board members are having to work with “a day-to-day solution.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Another Annapolis theater has been in a similar situation. The Colonial Players, a non-profit, all-volunteer organization had to push back their shows as well, as a result of the pandemic.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div id="finances">
            <div class="sectitle">The Cost of the Pandemic</div>
          <p>
            The theater does own its rehearsal and performance space, but has financial concerns over production deposits that have already been made and the salaries for the support staff, since the theater does not have any income coming in.
          </p>

          <p>
            Steve Tobin, the vice president of the Colonial Players, said via a phone interview that the theater is very thankful for donations in lieu of tickets from the community.
          </p>

          <p>
            The donations are tax-deductible donations to the theater.
          </p>

          <p>
            “We’re very grateful that it looks right now—at least right now—that the financial impacts are not as bad as they could have been,” Tobin said, thanks to the donations.
          </p>

          <p>
            He continued that though people have their own financial issues, they still donate — and that is “very heartwarming.”
          </p>

          <blockquote>
              “Just because we don’t pay people doesn’t mean that we haven’t put in blood, sweat and tears.”
              <br><div class="attr">-Steve Tobin, Vice President of the Colonial Players</div>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            “Through their generosity, we will be able to recover relatively quickly in the fall,” Tobin said. “That’s a gift from our patrons.”
          </p>

          <p>
            The Annapolis Summer Garden Theatre also faces production-related financial concerns.
          </p>

          <p>
            Having to give refunds to people who have already bought tickets “is a scary situation,” Kirby said.
          </p>

          <p>
            She said that $43,000 worth of tickets were sold and now the situation is extremely uncertain, with the team having to consider canceling their upcoming shows.
          </p>

          <p>
            Theaters all over the country are suffering the same financial burden. A survey conducted by the Theatre Communications Group, which was released in March 2020, predicted losses that were likely to reach over $500 million by June.

          <p>
            The Broadway League, which is the trade association for Broadway theater across North America, releases the weekly gross totals for Broadway shows during each week of a season (a season in Broadway starts at the beginning of June and ends the following May). The past season's weekly gross totals followed the trends of the previous two seasons until lockdown. Because Broadway was shut down for the last ten weeks of the season, the season total came in about $500 million short of the previous season's total - just as the Theatre Communications Group Projected. By the time Broadway theaters re-open, they will have been shut down for an entire season.

          <p>
            Aside from the financial concerns, the performance and production teams also face a disappointment factor — of having worked months on a show and not getting to perform.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Colonial Players, the Annapolis Summer Garden Theatre and the Annapolis Shakespeare Company expressed disappointment over the loss of shows.
          </p>

          <p>
            Shirley Panek, president of the Colonial Players theater, also works as the vice president of a technology firm — as do most of the theater’s volunteers. “We do what we do because it’s a passion,” she said.
          </p>

          <p>
            “Just because we don’t pay people doesn’t mean that we haven’t put in blood, sweat and
            tears,” Tobin said.
          </p>

          <p>
            “They (the performers) are disappointed, but they understand,” Kirby said.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            "For us, it's part of who we are."
            <br><div class="attr">-Jason Vellon, performer</div>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            Sally Boyett, artistic director with the Annapolis Shakespeare Company, told Capital News Service that their theater had to lay off all their staff except for her and another member.
          </p>

          <p>
            Boyett said it was devastating to see people she had employed for a show watch that show be shut down.
          </p>

          <p>
            She continued that though they understand “what has to happen for the public health” that it doesn’t take away from the devastation it has caused for the artists.
          </p>

          <p>
            One of the key issues coming back from the pandemic shutdowns will be to get the audiences to get back into the habit of watching the plays, Boyett said.
          </p>

          <p>
            Though she continued that she hopes for the best as “there’s only so much Netflix you can take.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Jason Vellon works at Sandy Spring Bank, and also as a performer.
          </p>

          <p>
            Though most community performers do it for the enjoyment of the work rather than the monetary compensation, he said that having a show canceled “is like a death, it’s like something is being ripped from you.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Vellon and his wife, Ashley Gladden-Vellon, were set to perform this week at the Anne Arundel Community College Theater for the show “Beauty and the Beast” and through a tough audition, his wife was cast as Belle and he as Gaston.
          </p>

          <p>
            When the director, who is also Vellon’s friend, was telling his wife that the show had to be canceled, she started shedding tears, and so did the director.
          </p>

          <p>
            “You know that, that it was the right choice to stop that show,” Vellon said. “But it is still a painful loss.”
          </p>

          <p>
            “Being on stage, it’s kind of like a drug,” he said. But he continued that “for us, it’s part of who we are.”

          </div>

          <p>
            The impact on theater workers in Maryland refelcts the loss felt by theater workers across the country - especially in New York. According to Browadway League President Charlotte St. Martin, Broadway employs over 97,000 people. These workers have been out of work for uch longer than they anticipated.
          </p>

          <p>
            Originally, Broadway theaters were shut down for six weeks at the beginning of the pandemic. However, on October 9, after months of uncertainty, the Broadway League officially announced that all 41 Broadway theaters would remain closed through at least may of 2021. This shutdown had originally been scheduled to last until January 3, but worsening circumstances surrounding the virus forced Broadway's trade association to make this decision.
          </p>

          <p>
            St. Martin has stated her committment to re-opening theaters as soon and safely as possible, saying "our membership is committed to re-opening as soon as conditions permit us to do so."

          <p>
            Theaters everywhere have made necessary adjustments and sacrifices in order to combat the spread of the Coronavirus. In August, <em>The Guardian</em> reported that the job losses in the theater industry had risen to 5,000 - most of those being in London. The continued job losses came on the heels of the government not allocating funds for arts workers in their Coronavirus relief package.

          <p>
            Some theaters have found ways to keep theater in the public consciousness during the pandemic. On December 1, the Royal National Theatre launched streaming service where users could pay to watch recorded versions of previous productions at the National Theatre.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some theaters, such as the Seattle Repertory Theatre, have been using their resources to engage the commuunity in other ways. They used the space for the location of a pop-up blood drive and their website lists programming ranging from youth engagement to virtual panels on race. Other Theaters, like the Guthrie Theatre in Minneapolis and the Milwaukee Repertory Theater, are selling tickets to virtual productions.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is clear that theater as an art can adapt, but there is no denying that the inability to gather in groups has wide-reaching financial consequence across many industries.

        <div id="industries">
          <div class="sectitle">How is Theater Doing Compared to Other Industries?</div>
          <p>
            The theatre industry is by no means the only industry losing massive amounts of money due to COVID restrictions. In June, the National Restaurant Association released results from a survey that said the losses of the industry at that point had already reached $120 billion during the first three months of the pandemic.
          </p>

          <iframe title="Estimated 2020 Profit Losses for Different Industries" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-4KLGB" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/4KLGB/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="200"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
          </script>

          <p>
            Though figures seemed to be getting better in May, an official from the National Restaurant Association stated that they were still reporting massive losses.
          </p>
          <p>
            "On average during the last five years, May sales at eating and drinking places were more than 5% higher than the average monthly sales volume for the entire year," the official said. "This year, May sales were more than 40% lower than what would have been expected in the absence of the pandemic."
          </p>

          <p>
            Much like live theater, the live concert industry is facing major losses due to the pandemic. A report from <em>Pollstar</em>, the trade publication of the concert industry, stated that the concert industry was set to lose as much as $9 billion in 2020. According to the report, this projection does not include "losses of income by musicians, technicians, dancers and others in its sprawling supply chain."
          </p>

          <p>
            There are very few winners in this situation. Concerns about the virus and the financial toll its taken on several industries leave many of us wondering how we can adapt and avoid another catastrophe. For now, we just have to sit an wait, hoping we go back to what we remember as normal.
